By constructing a model that considered each of these factors individually I hoped to determine which were more important to graduate schools when considering applicants."

    "The results of this project are generally in line with common sense: each of the predictor variables has a natural value judgement (e.g. \"higher GPA = better\") so their positive impact on graduate admissions is to be expected. More surprising is the importance of undergraduate rank on this process, and how it can seem to override all other predictor variables; for instance, a student at a low-ranked undergrad, even with a perfect GRE and GPA, is still quite unlikely to get into grad school.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further exploration here, I would like to see more student-level information (academic major, location, demographics, etc.) to test whether the \"rank\" variable is related to any latent effects of other factors influencing graduate admission. I'm also curious about these trends at different types of graduate schools: for instance, do STEM programs value undergraduate GPA more than other types of programs? Finally, I would like to see this type of data across a wide span of time, to investigate whether the relative importance of things like GPA and the GRE have changed over the years."
