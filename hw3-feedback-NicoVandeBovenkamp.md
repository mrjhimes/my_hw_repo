### ***Project 3 Feedback***

**Overall:** Good work on this one! We had already discussed many of aspects of the homework prior to sending this feedback, but, nonetheless, good job! And still appreciate the SVM.

**Some further work:** Again, always think about what metrics you could use to measure how well your model learned the data! ROC Curves and AUC scores are very, very handy for classifiers. And keep on with the cross-validation, hyper-parameter tuning, all the good stuff. Additionally, maybe read into [model stacking](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/12/27/a-kagglers-guide-to-model-stacking-in-practice/), which turns out to work exceptionally well. (Here is another walkthrough using the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python).
