**Overall** Your answers are on point! Not sure if you are already well versed in coding/python, but you made very good use of formatting and method appending. Also, nice use of statistical tests and a probit model!

***If you'd like:*** I can tell that you are very comfortable with this material. In the next homework, we will be fitting a logistic regression to the data, which won't be much more than what you have already done. If you are interested, I would encourage you to try out the Logistic Regression, as well as a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is another classifier that can be a bit more robust to outliers, and it is non-parametric (and either linear or non-linear). [My bet is this is new, so check it out](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.htmlhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
